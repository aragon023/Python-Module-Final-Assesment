        Articles
    </h1>
    <p>This is where I share thoughts, tools, and experiments from the world of design, innovation, and strategy.</p>
    <p>Sometimes it's a deep dive into a creative method or framework, other times it's a reflection on how technology is shaping the way we work, think, and build. These articles are part blog, part notebook—ideas in progress meant to spark conversation, curiosity, and maybe even a few “aha” moments. Whether you're a fellow designer, strategist, founder, or just someone who loves solving interesting problems, there's something here for you.</p>
